# Markdown extension 

Unveil add a single feature to the markdown spec. You can add a class to a markdown
element with the `[class=\"my-class\"]` attribute.

## Example : 

```markdown
[[class=\"fab fa-github fa-2x\"]](https://github.com/oknozor/unveil-rs)
```

This line (with no escaping on double quotes) would produce the following link :
[[class=\"fab fa-github fa-2x\"]](https://github.com/oknozor/unveil-rs). 

You can combine this with stylematter to change edit a slide styling.
